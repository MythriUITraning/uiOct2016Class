                    <p>The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it.
                        If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.[4]

                        The Elements of Typographic Style states that "at least one en [space]" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first,[4] noting that that is the "practical minimum".
                        An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent.
                        Miles Tinker, in his book Legibility of Print, concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on the average.

                        Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents
                        the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude.

                    <p>
                        Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time.

                        The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate.
